## Abstract

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a promising means of communication and
control for individuals with limited mobility due to neurological disorders or injuries.
Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are a type of BCI paradigm
that rely on the brainâ€™s response to specific visual frequencies. Single frequency
SSVEP suffers from the limited number of targets thus dual-SSVEP paradigms were
proposed. Conventional dual-SSVEP paradigms, however, suffer from limitations such
as intermodulation of harmonic components, which can result in reduced accuracy
and reliability.

This study aims to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel dual-SSVEP
paradigm using virtual reality (VR) technology. By presenting SSVEP stimuli to
each eye separately in a VR environment, we hypothesize that intermodulation of
harmonic components can be mitigated, ultimately improving the accuracy and
reliability of the SSVEP response. In this thesis, we design and implement a VR-
based dual-SSVEP paradigm, evaluate its performance in terms of reliability, and
compare its performance to a conventional dual-SSVEP paradigm.
